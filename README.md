# InternSavy Data Science Internship Projects

This repository contains three data science projects completed during my internship at InternSavy. Each project showcases different machine learning techniques and data analysis skills. Below is a brief description of each project:

## Project 1: Admission Prediction using Classification Techniques

In this project, I developed a classification model to predict the likelihood of admission based on various factors such as GRE score, TOEFL score, university rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, and research experience. The model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting admission outcomes and identified positive correlations between GRE score, TOEFL score, and CGPA with the likelihood of admission.

## Project 2: Unveiling Mall Customer Segmentation - A Clustering Analysis Approach

In this project, I performed clustering analysis on a mall customers dataset to identify distinct customer segments based on their annual income and spending score. Using the K-means clustering algorithm, I visualized and analyzed the clusters to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences.

## Project 3: Customer Segmentation Analysis - Uncovering Insights and Patterns for Business Optimization

This project involved applying K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering to analyze customer segments based on age, annual income, and spending score. Additionally, I used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction to visualize customer segments in a two-dimensional space.

Each project directory contains the Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and any additional resources used for analysis and model development. Feel free to explore the projects and provide feedback or suggestions.
