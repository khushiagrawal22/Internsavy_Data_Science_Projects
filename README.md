# InternSavy Data Science Internship Projects

Welcome to my INTERNSAVY Data Science Internship Projects repository! Here, I have showcased the three exciting data science projects I completed during my internship at INTERNSAVY. Each project demonstrates various data analysis and machine learning techniques to tackle real-world challenges. Read on to explore the projects and their key findings.

## Project 1: Admission Prediction using Classification Techniques

In this project, I developed a classification model to predict the likelihood of admission based on various factors such as GRE score, TOEFL score, university rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, and research experience. The model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting admission outcomes and identified positive correlations between GRE score, TOEFL score, and CGPA with the likelihood of admission.

## Project 2: Unveiling Mall Customer Segmentation - A Clustering Analysis Approach

In this project, I performed clustering analysis on a mall customers dataset to identify distinct customer segments based on their annual income and spending score. Using the K-means clustering algorithm, I visualized and analyzed the clusters to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences.



## Project 3: Customer Segmentation Analysis - Uncovering Insights and Patterns for Business Optimization

This project involved applying K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering to analyze customer segments based on age, annual income, and spending score. Additionally, I used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction to visualize customer segments in a two-dimensional space.
