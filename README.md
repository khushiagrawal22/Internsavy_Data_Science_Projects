# INTERNSAVY Data Science Internship Projects

Welcome to my INTERNSAVY Data Science Internship Projects repository! Here, I have showcased the three exciting data science projects I completed during my internship at INTERNSAVY. Each project demonstrates various data analysis and machine learning techniques to tackle real-world challenges. Read on to explore the projects and their key findings.

## Project 1: Admission Prediction using Classification Techniques

🔍 **Problem Statement:** With increasing competition in college admissions, accurate prediction models are essential. My task was to develop a model that predicts the likelihood of admission based on various factors.

💡 **Approach:** Leveraging machine learning and the Random Forest Classifier algorithm, I built a model using features like GRE score, TOEFL score, university rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, and research experience.

📊 **Key Findings:**
- Achieved high accuracy in predicting admission outcomes.
- The model demonstrated strong performance in identifying admitted candidates.
- Identified positive correlations between GRE score, TOEFL score, and CGPA with the likelihood of admission.

💭 **Insights:** While the model provides valuable predictions, it's important to consider it as part of a holistic evaluation process. Other factors like application materials and interviews should also be taken into account.

🌟 **Lessons Learned:** This project provided hands-on experience in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Overcoming outliers and ensuring data quality were significant challenges that enhanced my data analysis skills.



## Project 2: Unveiling Mall Customer Segmentation - A Clustering Analysis Approach

🔍 **Problem Statement:** In this project, I explored the mall customer dataset to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score. The goal was to uncover distinct customer groups for targeted marketing strategies.

💡 **Approach:** I employed the K-means clustering algorithm and hierarchical clustering to identify customer segments. Additionally, principal component analysis (PCA) was utilized for dimensionality reduction and visualization.

📊 **Key Findings:**
- Identified five distinct customer segments based on income and spending score.
- Visualized the clusters using scatter plots and dendrograms to understand customer groupings.
- Utilized PCA to visualize the segments in a two-dimensional space.

💭 **Insights:** Customer segmentation enables businesses to develop personalized marketing strategies and optimize their offerings for specific customer groups.

🌟 **Lessons Learned:** This project enhanced my skills in clustering analysis, visualization techniques, and PCA for dimensionality reduction.

## Project 3: Customer Segmentation Analysis - Uncovering Insights and Patterns for Business Optimization

🔍 **Problem Statement:** In this project, I performed customer segmentation analysis to uncover meaningful customer groups based on age, annual income, and spending score.

💡 **Approach:** I applied both K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering to the customer data. I also used PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization.

📊 **Key Findings:**
- Identified five customer segments based on age, income, and spending score.
- Visualized customer segments using scatter plots and dendrograms.
- Employed PCA to visualize segments in a reduced two-dimensional space.

💭 **Insights:** Understanding customer segments aids in tailoring strategies to cater to specific customer preferences, leading to improved customer satisfaction and overall business performance.

🌟 **Lessons Learned:** This project provided valuable experience in clustering analysis, hierarchical clustering, and PCA for dimensionality reduction.
